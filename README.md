### Demo ###
A development server is hosted at: 
https://renlab.sdsc.edu/omics

### Project motivation###
One major challenge of OMICS data analysis is that the field is developing so fast and the information is so scattered (personal blogs, tool tutorials, online courses), and a lot of them are not maintained. We need a website that will gather knowledge in one place, keep it updated and easily navigable (this will be extremely useful for beginners), and foster a healthy online community for bioinformatics scientists. 

We’re planning a website that is built with an educational wiki, a software database and Q&A, and some other additional components. There is no such website to my knowledge, though there are some websites that have a subset of the features. Like BioStars (Q&A), seqAnswers(Q&A), OMICTools(Software), NGSwikibook(wiki), etc. These features together will be great resources for graduate students/postdocs working on OMICS projects. 

Having the software database integrated into the website will make software easier to use, since most software programs are severely under-documented and at the same time full of bugs. We can create a venue for users to discuss their experience with a program, greatly expanding the understanding of the program and helping others who're having the same issues/concerns.

The website is built with python/Django framework and "fully functional" at this moment. In terms of contents, I've written something on ChIP-Seq (https://renlab.sdsc.edu/omics/wiki/ChIP-seq/) and PePr (The software that I developed, https://renlab.sdsc.edu/omics/wiki/PePr/) because I'm most familiar with these subjects. However, to make it really useful, we need to have more wiki articles on all sub-fields of OMICS analysis, more software and more questions. We also need ideas for more features to the website. Obviously it's a lot of work and I could not accomplish this on my own :( If you like this idea and want to help (or know someone else who’d like to help), please let me know! Also let me know of any comments you may have. Thanks!
