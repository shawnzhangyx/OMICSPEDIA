<h4> Questions </h4>
Questions are for users who's looking for a solution to a problem. The question should be as specific as possible and provide enough details for others to answer the question. Answers and comments can be attempted for questions. The original question creater could select a best answer for his question. 
Example.   
<h4> Discussions </h4>
Dicussions are usually open-ended questions or observations that would potentially lead to extended discussions. Replies could be added to the thread, just like a regular forum. Comments are disabled. When a discussion inspires useful reply chains, users/moderators are encouraged to summarize the discussion so that late-comers can digest the information easily.   
Example.   

<h4> Blogs </h4> 
Users can use blogs to share personal experiences, ideas and any other content. Only comments are available for blogs. 
Example.
