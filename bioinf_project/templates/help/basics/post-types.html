<h3>What are different post types and what they are for? </h3>
There are three post types: questions, discussions, and blogs. 
<h4> Questions </h4>
Questions should be as specific as possible and provide enough details for others to answer the question. The user who is asking a question should be looking for a solution to a problem. Example.   
<h4> Discussions </h4>
Dicussions are usually open-ended questions or observations that would potentially lead to extended discussions. Example.   

<h4> Blogs </h4> 
Users can use blogs to share personal experiences, ideas and any other content. Only comments are available for blogs. Example.
