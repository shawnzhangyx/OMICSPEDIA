<h2> Vote </h2>
Users are <b>strongly encouraged</b> to vote on the post or software that they liked. Vote can be cast on any post(question, discussion, blog and replies), comment and software. Votes carry a lot of weight in helping others to identify good materials, though requires minimal efforts (only a double click!). 

<h2> Bookmark </h2>
Wiki pages, tags, software, and posts are bookmarkable. Users can view their bookmarks in their profiles. If a tag(software) is bookmarked, user will receive updates from that tag (such as new posts, new wiki pages with that tag); if a wiki page is bookmarked, users will be notified by new revisions; if a post is bookmarked, users will have access to new answers or comments to that post. The notifications are located on the top bar. Users can also get e-mail updates in addition to the notifications. This can be changed in the <em>Userprofile>Settings</em>.
