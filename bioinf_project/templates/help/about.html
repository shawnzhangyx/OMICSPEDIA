<h3> "Vision" </h3>
<p> A major challenge for bioiformations nowadays is that this field is developing so fast that the resources are so scattered. We think it will be extremely useful to build an "eco-system" where the most updated and comprehensive knowledge could be brought into one piece and made readily available, and where bioinformatians could share experience, ideas and inspire each other, where no one will feel helpless and overwhelemed by OMICS. </p>
