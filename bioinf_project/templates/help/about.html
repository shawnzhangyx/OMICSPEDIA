<h2> About Omicspedia </h2>

All components will be tagged to certain OMICS workflow, therefore making the contents easily navigatable. For more details please read <a href="{%url 'help-page' 'basics/omicspedia-details'%}">this page</a>.</p>
<h2> "Vision" </h2>
<p> A major challenge for bioiformacians is that this field is developing so fast that the resources are so scattered. We think it will be extremely useful to build an online community where the most updated and comprehensive knowledge could be brought into one piece and made readily available, and where bioinformacians could share experience, ideas and inspire each other</p>
